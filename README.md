# meal-planner

meal-planner is a personal project that combines the power of Nutritionix and Spoonacular APIs to provide detailed nutrition information and recipe recommendations. Whether you're tracking the nutritional content of your meals or searching for recipes based on ingredients you have on hand, meal-planner makes it easy and intuitive. I chose Python/FastAPI for the back-end for simplicity and JS/React for the front-end.
